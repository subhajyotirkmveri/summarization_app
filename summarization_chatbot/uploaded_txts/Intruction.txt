Need to dwonload the llama2 model and save in locally link: https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGML/blob/main/llama-2-7b-chat.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin

https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GGUF/tree/main

mention the model in model_path  = "\copy the model_path\"

PDF file present in app folder

To test this llama2 model there is two python file 
1)app.py 
2)base.py


create conda environment with dependency present in requirements.txt file:-

- Open app.py file:- (streamlit UI Interface)

_ Open base.py file (streamlit UI Interface)
                          	in that there is a two function 
		1)create_vector_db()
		2)retrieval_qa_chain()
	First call create_vector_db() funtion (It create the embedding and directly save in locally)
	second call retrieval_qa_chain() function (To train the model set up the langchain with llama2 model )
